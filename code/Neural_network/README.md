Run the python files in the following order:
- clustering.py : to create the clusters
- data_preprocessing.py : format the data for the neural net
							*) duplicate lines,
							*) random affixes,
							*) keep 10 points in each POLYLINE
- training_neural_net.py : to train the neural network


neural_net.py is the file where we define the architechture of the neural net and the loss function
